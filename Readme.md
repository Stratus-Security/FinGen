# FinGen - Penetration Testing Findings Generator
FinGen is a ChatGPT based findings generator to help save penetration testers time and provide more readable findings.

It generates findings with the following properties:
- Description
- Remediation
- Implication
- Risk Rating (With likelihood + impact)
- _Sometimes_ extra helpful info like a risk rating justification
> **_NOTE:_**  It generally gives accurate findings but make sure to verify and add context in a real report.  
> Swap the model (see code) if you have GPT-4 for better findings.

## Quick Start
You just need 2 things to run it:
- An API key from OpenAI (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Any finding title
> **_NOTE:_**  The OpenAI API is paid, the cost is ~1c per 100 findings and you can get an $18 free trial.

### Run from pip
```
pip3 install FinGen
python3 -m FinGen --api-key "<api_key>" --title "Auto Complete Not Disabled"
```

### Run from source
```
git clone https://github.com/Stratus-Security/FinGen
cd FinGen
pip3 install openai
python3 FinGen.py --api-key "<api_key>" --title "Auto Complete Not Disabled"
```

## Usage
Generate a single finding with the perspective of a tester from Stratus Security
```
python3 FinGen.py --api-key "<api_key>" --title "Auto Complete Not Disabled" --company "Stratus Security"
```

We can also generate multiple findings at once
```
python3 FinGen.py --api-key "<api_key>" --title "Auto Complete Not Disabled" --title "Blind SQL Injection" --title "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting" 
```
